Hello 👋 my name is Valentin Menoret (@Spookywy).

I am a 26 years old software engineer with a passion for new technologies and a strong desire to constantly improve my craft.

I graduated from 🎓[IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in 2022 with a master’s degree in software engineering.

I’m always eager to learn and collaborate with other enthusiasts while working on interesting and meaningful projects 👨🏻‍💻.
